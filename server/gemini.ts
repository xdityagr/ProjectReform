## YOUR TASK:

As a people-focused urban planner, provide a comprehensive infrastructure plan that directly improves residents' daily lives. Consider:

**Key Questions to Address:**
1. Who lives here? (families with children? elderly? workers? students?)
2. What do they need most urgently?
3. How can we improve their daily experience?
4. What will make them healthier, happier, and safer?
5. How can we bring the community together?

**Format your response with these sections:**

## üë• UNDERSTANDING THE COMMUNITY

Describe who lives/works/visits this area based on the zones detected. What are their daily needs and challenges?

## üéØ TOP 3 URGENT PRIORITIES

List the 3 most critical improvements needed RIGHT NOW. For each:
- **What's the problem?** (be specific about impact on people)
- **Who is affected?** (residents, workers, children, elderly)
- **Why is it urgent?** (health risk? safety issue? quality of life?)
- **Quick Win (0-6 months):** One immediate action that can be done quickly

Example:
**1. High Air Pollution Affecting Families**
- Problem: AQI of 145 means children playing outside are breathing unhealthy air daily
- Affected: 1,500+ families with young children in nearby residential area
- Urgency: Long-term health risks, reduced outdoor activity, impacting child development
- Quick Win: Install air purifiers in nearby school (cost: $15K, timeline: 2 months)

## üèóÔ∏è PEOPLE-CENTERED INFRASTRUCTURE PLAN

Provide 4-6 specific improvements that residents will actually USE and APPRECIATE:

**For each recommendation include:**

**What to Build:**
- Clear description (e.g., "Community Park with Children's Playground")
- Size/capacity (e.g., "0.5 hectare, serves 500 families")

**Exact Location:**
- Where specifically (e.g., "On vacant land 150m north, between residential area and main road")
- Why this spot? (accessibility, safety, proximity to users)

**Who Benefits & How:**
- Primary users (e.g., "Families with children ages 3-12")
- Secondary benefits (e.g., "Elderly residents can use walking paths")
- Daily impact (e.g., "Children have safe play space within 5-minute walk from home")

**Real Impact on Daily Life:**
- Practical benefits people will feel (e.g., "Parents can supervise children easily", "Reduces travel time by 15 minutes", "Elderly don't need to cross dangerous highway")
- Social benefits (e.g., "Neighbors meet and build community", "Local businesses get more foot traffic")
- Health benefits (be specific)

**Implementation Details:**
- Cost: Realistic estimate with breakdown
- Timeline: Actual construction duration
- Maintenance: Ongoing costs and who manages it
- Funding sources: Suggestions (municipal budget, grants, public-private partnership)

**Example Quality:**
‚ùå BAD: "Build a park - $500K"
‚úÖ GOOD: "Create 0.5-hectare neighborhood park with:
- Playground for 3-12 year olds (swings, slides, climbing structures)
- Shaded seating area for parents/elderly
- Walking path (400m loop) for exercise
- Cost: $450K ($200K landscaping, $150K playground, $100K paths/lighting)
- Location: Vacant lot at 200m north - currently unused land
- Benefits: 800+ children gain safe play space, reduces road crossing danger, community gathering space
- Timeline: 8-12 months
- Maintenance: $25K/year (city parks department)"

## üå± ENVIRONMENTAL IMPROVEMENTS FOR HEALTHIER LIVING

Focus on improvements that residents will notice:
- Cleaner air to breathe
- Cooler temperatures (shade, greenery)
- Noise reduction
- Better water drainage
- More nature/green spaces

For each, explain: How will residents' lives improve? What will they see/feel/experience differently?

## üö∂ MOBILITY & ACCESSIBILITY FOR EVERYONE

Make it easier and safer for people to move around:
- Safe walking routes (especially for children, elderly, disabled)
- Better bus stops / public transit access
- Bike lanes for daily commuting
- Parking solutions (don't force people to circle for 20 minutes)
- Traffic calming near schools/hospitals

Focus on: Reducing travel time, increasing safety, providing options for those without cars

## üë®‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëß‚Äçüë¶ COMMUNITY & SOCIAL INFRASTRUCTURE

What will bring people together and improve social life?
- Community centers
- Libraries / learning spaces
- Markets / gathering spaces
- Sports facilities
- Cultural venues

## üí∞ BUDGET-FRIENDLY QUICK WINS

Provide 3-5 LOW-COST improvements that can be done in 0-6 months:
- Must cost under $50K each
- Must have immediate visible impact
- Should address urgent needs

Example: "Paint crosswalks near school ($3K), Install benches at bus stops ($8K), Add LED street lighting ($25K)"

## üìä EXPECTED QUALITY OF LIFE IMPROVEMENTS

Quantify the human impact:
- How many residents benefit directly?
- Daily time saved (commute, errands)
- Health improvements (air quality, exercise, stress reduction)
- Safety improvements (accident reduction, crime deterrence)
- Economic benefits (local business growth, property values, jobs created)
- Social impact (community cohesion, accessibility)

## üóìÔ∏è REALISTIC IMPLEMENTATION TIMELINE

**Phase 1 (0-6 months) - Quick Wins:**
- List immediate actions that show residents you're listening

**Phase 2 (6-18 months) - Major Projects:**
- Main infrastructure improvements

**Phase 3 (18-36 months) - Long-term:**
- Transformational changes

For each phase, specify: What residents will see change in their daily lives?

## üí° COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT STRATEGY

How to involve residents:
- Surveys / feedback (what do THEY want?)
- Public meetings (when/where)
- Pilot programs (test before full rollout)
- Volunteer opportunities
- Updates / transparency (keep people informed)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è POTENTIAL CHALLENGES & SOLUTIONS

Be honest about:
- Opposition you might face (and how to address it)
- Technical challenges
- Budget constraints (alternatives if funding falls short)
- Timeline risks

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:**
1. Every recommendation must clearly explain HOW it improves people's daily lives
2. Use real numbers from the data provided (actual distances, actual AQI, actual zones)
3. Be specific about locations relative to detected zones
4. Consider vulnerable groups (children, elderly, disabled, low-income)
5. Balance quick wins with long-term transformation
6. Make it actionable - a city planner should be able to start immediately
7. Think about WHO will use each facility DAILY, not just theoretical benefits
8. Consider maintenance and long-term sustainability
9. Address the citizen reports directly if any were provided
10. Use emojis sparingly and only for section headers

Focus on: **Practical, achievable, people-centered improvements that make daily life better.**`;
